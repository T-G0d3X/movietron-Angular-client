## *Description*

 Using Angular, Client-side for an application called Movietron based on its existing server-side code I built before as one of my projects ([REST API and database](https://github.com/T-G0d3X/Movietron-API)), with supporting documentation. 


## *Key Features*

 - App displays a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account. 
   
 - Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies. 
 -  Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where additional movie details will be displayed. 
 - The single movie view will contain the following additional features: 
 
       1. A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the director of that  particular movie will be displayed. 
       2. A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed.
